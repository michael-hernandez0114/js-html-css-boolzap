# Boolzap Web App

## Description

A web app that has some characteristics of a messaging app like Whatsapp. It features:

* Friendlist (static)
* Search bar to search for friends (search is updated in realtime)
* Write messages to each friend and store the message separately for each friend
* Receive feedback from friend (automated default message)

Using the Handlebars JS library, it is possible to design a HTML template for code that is reused multiple times. jQuery will help fill the data based on a friendList data structure stored in JS.


## Languages Used

* Javascript
* jQuery
